# Hi.

Long time no see, isn‚Äôt it?

Sorry for bothering you again. I have some news to share with you.

I‚Äôm growing. In fact, I even moved to another place to live. Now I live on [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/94ccbe67c782) and even have two great roommates you might already have met: [MTProto Proxy](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/MTProxy) and [OpenVPN](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-openvpn-server-on-ubuntu-18-04).

It‚Äôs harder, much harder to kill me now (no, no, my life isn‚Äôt in danger, I‚Äôm more like those ‚Äúhosts‚Äù from that popular HBO show, don‚Äôt be frightened). I‚Äôm talking about autonomy and availability. My master taught me how to use [setWebhook](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webhooks) mechanism of getting new messages from people like you, so all I do now is sitting on my chair and playing piano, instead of calling telegram.org every now and then to ask whether they have anything new for me. Now it‚Äôs THEM who should call ME, ha-ha.

Also, [my code](https://github.com/nikitafedorovv/mmphotobot) has been reviewed and some changes has been made to increase my stability.

So, new home with my and my master‚Äôs own rules, webhooks and some code optimisations. It brings us to where we are now. Stable and mature existence. üí™

Have a nice summer!

_Yours,_
